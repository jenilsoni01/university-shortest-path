# Shortest Path Visualization using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project is a web-based application for visualizing the shortest path between two points on a map of **Nirma University** using Dijkstra's algorithm. It uses **Leaflet.js** for map rendering and **GeoJSON** data for roads.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Select source and destination points by clicking on the map.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Visualize the shortest path on the map in real time.
- **GeoJSON Support**: Load road data from a GeoJSON file.
- **Graph Representation**: Converts map data into a graph structure for pathfinding.

## Deployment

You can view the live application here: [Shortest Path Visualizer](https://nirma-university-map.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- **Leaflet.js** for map rendering
- **GeoJSON** for road data
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path calculation
